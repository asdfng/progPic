This is my first project going up on GIT for this account, I'll be making an automated progress picture machine.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic I've gotten more serious about my fitness level.
A great way of tracking progress, in addition to tracking weight, is to take images periodically to qualitatively track muscle growth/fat loss. I could manually capture the image with my phone and then sort it in the appropriate album but I think it would be more fun and educational to build my own RPI based image capturing system.
